# Lessons

- **Pin dependencies to the environment that owns the production artifacts, not the
  dev machine.** (2026-07-02) Pinning requirements.txt from a local `pip freeze`
  downgraded CI (sklearn 1.9.0 → 1.5.2) under a cached predictor.pkl pickled at
  1.9.0 — the quick deploy crashed on unpickle (`LogisticRegression` lost
  `multi_class`). Rule: before pinning, read the versions out of the last
  successful CI run's install log; upgrade local to match, never the reverse.
  Cross-version pickle compatibility is the constraint, not "what my venv has".

- **A lockfile regenerated on one OS can be incomplete for another.** (2026-07-02)
  `npm install` on Windows wrote a package-lock.json missing Linux-side optional
  native deps (@emnapi/*); CI's `npm ci` refuses it. Rule: after adding a dep, run
  `npm install --package-lock-only` (computes the full cross-platform ideal tree)
  and verify with `npm ci` before committing the lockfile.
